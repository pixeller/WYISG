                <h2>ABOUT WORLD YOUTH ISLAMIC SOLIDARITY GAMES (WYISG)</h2>
                <p>THE WORLD YOUTH ISLAMIC  SOLIDARITY GAMES IS A HISTORIC MILESTONE CONCEPTUALIZED ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTHS PREDOMINANTLY HAILING FROM  MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE CONTINENTS OF ASIA, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND PARTS OF EASTERN EUROPE WITH A COMBINED POPULATION OF  MORE THAN 1.5  BILLION  OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION. </p>
                <p>MALAYSIA IS CURRENTLY HOLDING THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE 1ST EVER WORLD YOUTH ISLAMIC SOLIDARITY GAMES 2016. THEREFORE, MUCH CAN BE DONE USING THIS PLATFORM TO SHOW HOW SERIOUSLY WE UNDERTAKE THIS NOBLE RESPONSIBILITY. THE PROPOSED WORLD YOUTH ISLAMIC SOLIDARITY GAMES 2016 SHALL BRING TOGETHER YOUNG PEOPLE FROM 57 COUNTRIES TO MALAYSIA FOR THIS EVENT. </p>
                <p>MALAYSIA IS RENOWNED FOR ITS EXCELLENT FIRST CLASS FACILITIES AND HENCE THE CAPABILITY TO ORGANIZE THE GAMES OF THIS MAGNITUDE.</p>
                
                <p>The idea to organize the World Youth Islamic  Solidarity Games or WYISG was first mooted a few  years  back. The dearth of having a meaningful platform which could sustain and promote a United  Muslim Brotherhood (Ummah) among Youths from Major Muslim Nations  necessitated the setting up of such a multi sport solidarity event.</p>
                
                <p>In 2009 a serious and concerted effort was undertaken by a dedicated Malaysian team comprising Sport Officials and Professionals to kick start the campaign to bring to life  the 1st ever World Youth Islamic Solidarity Games. </p>
                
                <p>After a long struggle the dream has finally turned to reality now  with the advent of the WYISG 2016 Games to be held in Malaysia from 15 October 2016 until 23 October 2016 led by the  Founding Chair persons of the World Youth Islamic Solidarity Games WYISG16,  Tan Sri Datuk Seri Elyas Omar & the Late Datoâ€™ Dr. Raja Mohamad Abdullah.
