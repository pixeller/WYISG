                    <b> Cheng Hoon Teng Temple </b>
                        <p> Is a Chinese temple practicing the Three Doctrinal Systems of Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism located at Malacca town, Malaysia. It is the oldest functioning temple in Malaysia. It also known as The Green Clouds Temple. </p>
                        <p> Built in 1645 by Kapitan Lee Wei King with building materials imported from China, Cheng Hoon Teng served as the main place of worship for the local Hoklo (Hokkien) community. The main hall was built by Kapitan Chan Ki Lock in 1704 and was rebuilt in 1801 by Kapitan China Chua Su Cheong, who contributed to the aesthetic and magnificent structural additions of the building. </p>
                        <p> In 1962, then Abbot Seck Kim Seng ordained Houn Jiyu-Kennett, a Zen nun from England and the future founder of the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives, at this temple. </p>

Additional smaller prayer quarters were added later. One of these is dedicated to the Buddhist gods of wealth, longevity and propagation, while another houses ancestral tablets. </p>
                        <p> One of the most dramatic features of Cheng Hoon Teng temple is the seven-metre red flag-pole facing the left wing of the main prayer hall, which houses the remains of two of the three Kapitans who contributed to the construction of the temple. Across the road is a traditional opera theatre, which forms a part of the Cheng Hoon Teng temple complex. </p>
                        <p> The building conforms to the principles of feng shui. The complex is laid out to ensure a view of the river and high ground on either side. </p>

                        <p> The Jonker Walk is the Chinatown street of Malacca, Malaysia located along Jalan Hang Jebat. </p>
                        <p> Jalan Hang Jebat, or Jonker Walk is it commonly known, is a street in historical Chinatown of Melaka starting just across the river from the Dutch Square. Jonker Walk is flanked on both sides of the road with heritage houses dating back up to the 17th century. At that time, rich Baba Nonyas (also known as Perankans, descendents of 15th - 16th century Chinese immigrants marrying local Malay women) lived and did their business here. </p>
                        <p> During the Dutch Malacca, servants and subordinates of Dutch masters used to live at the nearby Heeren Street. However, as the Dutch left, it became noblemen's street. Rich Peranakans started to live and did business within the street area, giving the street a deep-rooted ethnic and cultural flavour. The road starts from across Malacca River near the Stadthuys. The road is filled with historical houses along its left and right sides dating back to 17th century. It also has shops selling antiques, textiles, foods, handicrafts and souvenirs </p>
                        <p> Today, the street houses many shops selling antiques, textiles, handicrafts and souvenirs. On the weekends, starting Friday night at 6pm, the road is closed off for traffic and turns in a very crowded night market. </p>

                    <b> Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum </b>
                        <p> The Baba & Nyonya House Museum, also known as the Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum, is a museum in Malacca, Malaysia. It showcases the local history of ethnic Chinese-Malays called Baba-Nyonya or Peranakan in Malacca. The museum was established in 1986 by Chan Kim Lay, the fourth generation of his family to reside in the large house built by his great-grandfather in 1896 in Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, a street also known as "Millionaire's Row" for its luxurious houses. The museum is known for its elaborate woodwork, furniture, and porcelain.  </p>
                        <p> The house is a combination of three terrace lots that were acquired by the Chan family in 1861. Four generations lived in the house before it was opened as a museum in March 1985. The name of the museum is derived from the term <i> Baba </i>, an honorific manner of addressing a Straits-born gentleman and <i> Nyonya </i> which addresses a Straits-born lady. </p>
                        <p> We welcome you on a journey into late 19th-century and early 20th-century Malaya.  Meander through the home of Baba Chan Cheng Siew (1865-1919) whose eclectic taste offers a glimpse into the richness of the culture and the opulence that was fashionable in many pre-World War II Peranakan homes. </p>
                        <p> Today the museum is still managed by the family. The vision is to revive Malaysia’s Peranakan identity and heritage. By preserving this house gives honour to the Peranakan spirit, keeping it alive for many generations. </p>

                    <b> Taming Sari Tower </b>

                    <b> Malacca Sultanate Palace Museum </b>
                        <p> The Malacca Sultanate Palace Museum is a museum located in Malacca, Malaysia. The building is a modern reconstruction of the palace of the sultans of Malacca. It showcases the history of the region. The museum building was constructed in 1984 and became a cultural museum. The museum was officially opened on 17 July 1986 by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. </p>
                        <p> The Malacca Sultanate Palace is actually a replica of the structure which was built by the already extinct sultanate of Malacca. The sultanate of Malacca was the ruler of the city before the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500s. The plan of the palace was based on the Malay Annals' account of Sultan Mansur Shah's palace. Sultan Mansur Shah was the nobleman who ruled Malacca from 1456 to 1477. The Malacca Sultanate Palace is one of its kind in Malaysia as it offers a rare glimpse of the ancient Malay kingdom which once flourished in Malacca. </p>
                        <p> Today, the palace is the home of the Cultural Museum which celebrates the Malay side of the Malacca's history. The museum showcases more than 1300 items of Malacca's past. There items include photographs, weaponry, drawings, musical instruments and gifts from foreign emissaries. All these items are displayed in eight different chambers and in three galleries on the three floors of the palace. Admission into the palace is RM2 per adult and RM0.50 per child. It is closed on Mondays and opens on Tuesdays to Sundays from 9am to 6pm. Since the palace is at the foot of St Paul's Hill, do not miss the chance to visit the St Paul's Church, which is at the top of the St Paul's Hill. </p>
                        <p> Along the way up the hill, you will also pass by some museums. They are the Architecture Museum Malacca and the Stamp Museum Malacca. Also close by is the Islamic Museum of Malacca where you can view displays of how Islam came to Malacca and spread to the entire country. There certainly are many places of interest to visit in Malacca. A day trip to this wonderful place is not adequate. Do consider staying at any hotels in Malacca as there are hotels of all types which will cater to your every need. </p>

                    <b> Stadthuys </b>
                        <p> The Stadthuys (an old Dutch spelling, meaning city hall), also known as the Red Square, is a historical structure situated in the heart of Malacca Town, the administrative capital of the state of Malacca, Malaysia. It was built by the Dutch occupants in 1650 as the office of the Dutch Governor and Deputy Governor. </p>
                        <p> When Malacca was handed over to the British in the 19th century, the Malacca Free School was opened in the vicinity of the Stadthuys on 7 December 1826, by missionaries residing in the state, in response to a letter dated 19 April 1825, signed by a J. Humprey, J. W. Overee and A. W. Baumgarten, which called for an English institutional education to be built in Malacca. The school which the British provided free education to residents was eventually renamed Malacca High School in 1871 upon a takeover by the British government, and moved out to its present site at Chan Koon Cheng Road in 1931. </p>
                        <p> Situated at Laksamana Road, beside the Christ Church, the supposed oldest remaining Dutch historical building in the Orient, is now the home of a Museum of History and Ethnography. Among the displays in the museum are traditional costumes and artefacts throughout the history of Malacca, which makes it Malacca's premier museum. </p>

                     <b> A Famosa </b>
                        <p> A Famosa is a Portuguese fortress located in Malacca, Malaysia. It is among the oldest surviving European architectural remains in South East Asia. The <i> Porta de Santiago </i>, a small gate house, is the only part of the fortress which still remains today.  </p>
                        <p> In 1511, a Portuguese fleet arrived under the command of Afonso de Albuquerque. His forces attacked and defeated the armies of the Malacca Sultanate. Moving quickly to consolidate his gains, Albuquerque had the fortress built around a natural hill near the sea. </p> 
                        <p> Albuquerque believed that Malacca would become an important port linking Portugal to the Spice Route in China. At this time other Portuguese were establishing outposts in such places as Macau, China and Goa, India to create a string of friendly ports for ships heading to Ming China and returning home to Portugal. </p>
                        <p> The fortress once consisted of long ramparts and four major towers. One was a four-story keep, while the others held an ammunition storage room, the residence of the captain, and an officers' quarters. Most of the village clustered in town houses inside the fortress walls. As Malacca's population expanded it outgrew the original fort and extensions were added around 1586. </p>
                        <p> The fort changed hands in 1641 when the Dutch drove the Portuguese out of Malacca.[1] The Dutch renovated the gate in 1670, which explains the logo "ANNO 1670" inscribed on the gate's arch. Above the arch is a bas-relief logo of the Dutch East India Company. </p>
                        <p> The fortress changed hands again in the late 18th century when the Dutch handed it over to the British to prevent it from falling into the hands of Napoleon's expansionist France. The English were wary of maintaining the fortification and ordered its destruction in 1806. The fort was almost totally demolished but for the timely intervention of Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore, who happened to visit Malacca in 1810. Because of his passion for history, this small gate was spared from destruction. </p>
                        <p> In late November 2006, a structure part of the fort, believed to be the Middelsburgh Bastion was accidentally uncovered during the construction of 110 meter revolving tower in Malacca Town. </p>
